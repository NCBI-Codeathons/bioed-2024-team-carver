# $\color{NavyBlue}{Project\ Summary}$
- The goal of the curriculum package is to provide a more accessible, authentic experience with actual genetic data. 
- Target Audience:\
  High School - both AP and 9th/10th grade biology students
  
- We are developing two different lesson plans
- For AP Biology, the content used/learned:\
  Lesson 1: (Can be used instead of "AP Biology Investigative Lab 3: The Blast Lab")\
  *comparative genetics across species, how those differences affect evolutionary relationships

  Lesson 2: Using NCBI Tools for High School Genetics Investigation\
  *comparative genetics within humans (identifying location of mutations and types of mutations by comparing "wild type" genes with mutated genes)\
  *predicting, describing, and understanding how variations and mutations can affect function\
  *can be used for review of Central Dogma
  
- For 9th/10th Grade Biology, the content used/learned:\
  Using NCBI Tools for High School Genetics Investigation\
  *comparative genetics within humans (identifying location of mutations and types of mutations by comparing "wild type" genes with mutated genes)\
  *predicting, describing, and understanding how variations and mutations can affect function\

<h3>$\color{Purple}{Students\ Will\ Be\ Able\ To:}$ </h3>

<ins>Lesson 1 (AP):</ins>\
~identify differences in nucleotide sequences between different species\
~predict with reasonable (will depend on level of student and prior teaching) accuracy the impact of the differences on the phylogenetic tree

<ins>Lesson 2 (AP):</ins>\
~find nucleotide region with differences using NBCI resources\
~identify differences in nucleotides (between wild type and mutated option)\
~identify the type of mutation present in the genetic sequence\
~predict impact of mutation &/or variation on function of resulting protein\
~use genetic sequences to produce mRNA sequences and resulting amino acid sequences (at AP level, discuss introns/exons and use NCBI resources to determine final mRNA sequence)\
~use NCBI resources to produce a 3D structure of the proteins\
~use the information gleaned from comparing the genetic sequences to analyze sample clinical cases and identify potential causes of symptoms in patients

<ins>9th/10th Grade Biology</ins>\
~find nucleotide region with differences using NBCI resources\
~identify differences in nucleotides (between wild type and mutated option)\
~identify the type of mutation present in the genetic sequence\
~predict impact of mutation &/or variation on function of resulting protein\
~use genetic sequences to produce mRNA sequences and resulting amino acid sequences

# $\color{Aquamarine}{Course\ Materials}$
Prior to starting the assignment,at any level, teachers can show this 50 second video that shows what happens to hemoglobin when the Sickle Cell mutation is present:\
[WEHI TV: Hemoglobin & Sickle Cell Anemia](https://www.wehi.edu.au/wehi-tv/haemoglobin-and-sickle-cell-anaemia/)

This video provides some insight into the symptoms of Sickle Cell Disease, as well as the possibility for a treatment based on a mutation in a second gene (fetal hemoglobin):\

# $\color{Cerulean}{Assessments:}$
The assignment itself is essentially an assessment - if a student can complete the assignment, then the student is demontrating that he/she/they know how to transcribe and translate a DNA sequence. Additionally, they show proficiency in using a codon chart. Finally, the student is demonstrating that he/she/they know and can apply the knowledge of the different types of mutations found in DNA sequences, as well the basic impact of each of those mutations.

# $\color{ProcessBlue}{Future\ Work:}$
Future Work Possibilites for the 9th/10th Grade Assignments:\
- Making corresponding protein sequences for the same mutated HBB genes, so that students can run a Protein BLAST and then compare amino acid sequences\
- Adding resources so that students can visualize 3D structures from the HBB protein with the mutations they analyzed.
