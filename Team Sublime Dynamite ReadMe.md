# $\color{NavyBlue}{Project\ Summary}$
- The goal of the curriculum package is to provide a more accessible, authentic experience with actual genetic data. 
- Target Audience:\
  High School - both AP and 9th/10th grade biology students
  
- We are developing two different lesson plans
- For AP Biology, the content used/learned:\
  Lesson 1: (Can be used instead of "AP Biology Investigative Lab 3: The Blast Lab")\
  *comparative genetics across species, how those differences affect evolutionary relationships

  Lesson 2: Using NCBI Tools for High School Genetics Investigation\
  *comparative genetics within humans (identifying location of mutations and types of mutations by comparing "wild type" genes with mutated genes)\
  *predicting, describing, and understanding how variations and mutations can affect function\
  *can be used for review of Central Dogma
  
- For 9th/10th Grade Biology, the content used/learned:\
  Using NCBI Tools for High School Genetics Investigation\
  *comparative genetics within humans (identifying location of mutations and types of mutations by comparing "wild type" genes with mutated genes)\

<h3>$\color{Purple}{Students\ Will\ Be\ Able\ To:}$ </h3>

<ins>Lesson 1 (AP):</ins>\
~identify differences in nucleotide sequences between different species\
~predict with reasonable (will depend on level of student and prior teaching) accuracy the impact of the differences on the phylogenetic tree

<ins>Lesson 2 (AP):</ins>\
~find nucleotide region with differences using NBCI resources\
~identify differences in nucleotides (between wild type and mutated option)\
~identify the type of mutation present in the genetic sequence\
~predict impact of mutation &/or variation on function of resulting protein\
~use genetic sequences to produce mRNA sequences and resulting amino acid sequences (at AP level, discuss introns/exons and use NCBI resources to determine final mRNA sequence)\
~use NCBI resources to produce a 3D structure of the proteins\
~use the information gleaned from comparing the genetic sequences to analyze sample clinical cases and identify potential causes of symptoms in patients

<ins>9th/10th Grade Biology</ins>\
~find nucleotide region with differences using NBCI resources\
~identify differences in nucleotides (between wild type and mutated option)\
~identify the type of mutation present in the genetic sequence\
~predict impact of mutation &/or variation on function of resulting protein\
~use genetic sequences to produce mRNA sequences and resulting amino acid sequences\

# $\color{Aquamarine}{Course\ Materials}$
Prior to starting the assignment,at any level, teachers can show this 50 second video that shows what happens to hemoglobin when the Sickle Cell mutation is present:\
[WEHI TV: Hemoglobin & Sickle Cell Anemia]([https://github.com/lifeparticle/Markdown-Cheatsheet](https://www.wehi.edu.au/wehi-tv/haemoglobin-and-sickle-cell-anaemia/)\

# $\color{Cerulean}{Assessments:}$
Coming soon!

# $\color{ProcessBlue}{Future\ Work:}$
Once we complete the lesson plans outlined above, along with all of the related documents, we will determine whether or not there will be further updates. However, we have uploaded the documents in formats that can be downloaded and edited.
