# $\color{NavyBlue}{Project\ Summary}$
- The goal of the curriculum package is to provide a more accessible, authentic experience with actual genetic data. 
- Target Audience:\
  High School - both AP and 9th/10th grade biology students
  
- We are developing two different lesson plans
- For AP Biology, the content used/learned:\
  Lesson 1: (Can be used instead of "AP Biology Investigative Lab 3: The Blast Lab")\
  *comparative genetics across species, how those differences affect evolutionary relationships\

  Lesson 2: Using NCBI Tools for High School Genetics Investigation\
  *comparative genetics within humans (identifying location of mutations and types of mutations by comparing "wild type" genes with mutated genes)\
  *predicting, describing, and understanding how variations and mutations can affect function\
  *can be used for review of Central Dogma\
