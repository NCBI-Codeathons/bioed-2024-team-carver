# $\color{NavyBlue}{Project\ Summary}$
- The goal of the curriculum package is to provide a more accessible, authentic experience with actual genetic data. 
- Target Audience:\ High School - both AP and 9th/10th grade biology students\
- Currently, we are developing 2 lesson plans:
- For AP Biology, the content used/learned: comparative genetics across species and evolutionary relationships
- For 9th/10th Grade Biology, the content used/learned: comparative genetics within humans and understanding/describing how variations and mutations affect function, and then apply this knowledge to sample clinical cases
